          Supporting your child in learning to read is one of the most amazing
          things you will ever do. It can be intimidating to have to approach
          this in a way that you were not taught in school. Here, you will find
          lots of information about phonics and how you can use these games to
          teach children to read.

            <h3>What is Phonics?</h3>
            <p>
              Phonics is a way of teaching children how to read by teaching them
              the sounds of each individual letter and the sounds made by
              combinations of different letters. You may notice that phonics
              sounds are different to the alphabet.
            </p>
            <p>
              The soudns made by these letters are called <span>phonemes.</span>
              These are the first phonemes your child will learn.<span>s</span>
              <span>a</span>
              <span>t</span>
              <span>p</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              When your child begins Phase 3, they will start to learn about{" "}
              <span>digraphs,</span>these are two letters that create one sound.

              Your child will start by learning to say the correct phoneme when
              they see s, a t, p, i and n. They will then develop their
              listening skills to be able to identify these phonemes as initial
              sounds in words.
